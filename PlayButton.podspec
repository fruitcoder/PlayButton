Since the button itself can be used in other projects as a button that switches between play and pause, it makes sense to have it as a separate CocoaPod. The special thing about the animation is that the CAKeyframe animation reverses when the user touches the button during animation. Since this is still not working 100% it remains in a different branch and is open for testing.'
